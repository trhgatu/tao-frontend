# The Archive Of One – The Fourth Sword

**"The Archive Of One is not just a portfolio. It's a living mirror of myself."**

T.A.O is a personal platform that goes beyond conventional portfolios. It reflects my journey, my thoughts, my creations, and my soul — structured into two realms:

---

## 🪐 Realms of TAO

### 🌌 Verse – The Soul Realm
A dreamy, poetic world that reflects my inner self.  
Includes:
- **Blog** – Personal thoughts, book reviews, analysis.
- **Journal** – Daily reflections and notes.
- **Memories** – Special photos, past moments, and stories.

> Interface: soft, floating, scroll-based, with aurora and glow effects.  
> Animation: cloudy transitions, vintage feel, gentle storytelling.

### 🔥 Forge – The Tech Realm
A fiery realm where passion and technology collide.  
Includes:
- **Projects** – Real fullstack systems with depth and scalability.
- **Tech Stack** – Skills, tools, technologies I've mastered.
- **Roadmap** – My 5-year growth plan as a developer.

> Interface: red–black–gray, bold and focused, with grid/hacker feel.  
> Animation: gear-loaders, system-init intro, fast transitions.

## 🧠 Philosophy

> "The Archive Of One không phải là nơi để gây ấn tượng, mà là nơi tao hiện diện thật nhất."

This is where I write, remember, reflect, and forge the swords that define me.  
Not made to chase a job — made to remember **who I am**.
